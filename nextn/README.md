## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project with live weather data, you'll need an API key from OpenWeatherMap.

1.  **Get an API Key**: Sign up for a free account on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and get your API key. Note that new API keys can take a couple of hours to become active.

2.  **Set up Environment Variable**: Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add your API key like this:

    ```
    OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

3.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will automatically use this key to fetch live data. If the key is not provided, it will fall back to using mock data.

## üîí Security & Publishing

It is **safe** to publish this project to a public GitHub repository. Your OpenWeatherMap API key is secure because:

1.  **`.gitignore` File**: This project includes a `.gitignore` file, which explicitly tells Git to **ignore** sensitive files like `.env.local`. This prevents your API key from ever being uploaded to GitHub.
2.  **Server-Side Logic**: All API calls are made from the server using Next.js Server Actions. Your API key is never exposed to the user's browser.

### Deploying to the Web

When you deploy your application to a hosting provider (like Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase App Hosting), you will need to set your API key as an **environment variable** in your hosting provider's settings dashboard.

1.  Go to your project's settings on your hosting platform.
2.  Find the section for "Environment Variables".
3.  Add a new variable with the following name and value:
    *   **Name**: `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`
    *   **Value**: `your_api_key_here`

The deployed application will then use this key to fetch live weather data.
