## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project with live weather data, you'll need an API key from OpenWeatherMap.

1.  **Get an API Key**: Sign up for a free account on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and get your API key. Note that new API keys can take a couple of hours to become active.

2.  **Set up Environment Variable**: Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add your API key like this:

    ```
    OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

3.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will automatically use this key to fetch live data. If the key is not provided, it will fall back to using mock data.
